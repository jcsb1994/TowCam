# Underwater Automated TowCam
This project has been developped in collaboration with the EEL Laboratory, affiliated with California State University, Monterey Bay.
Its main purpose is to increase seafloor mapping efficiency by combining the speed of a boat to the cheaper price of a camera 
compared to an ROV.

This camera uses custom 3D printed parts, and stock products from manufacturer Bluerobotics (https://www.bluerobotics.com).
