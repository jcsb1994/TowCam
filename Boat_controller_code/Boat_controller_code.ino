/*
  This code is a prototype for a controller, communicating via Serial to a arduino-based underwater camera

  INTERRUPT
  the controller works with an interrupt service routine on INT0 (D2). different values of resistors create different output values on A0, which is read
  when the interrupt on INT0 occurs.
  Buttons:
  UP
  DOWN
  SELECT

  LCD
  A 4x20 LCD Screen with I2C is used as a user-camera interface.
  This code uses F. Malpartida's NewLiquidCrystal library and Wire llibrary to control the I2C LCD
  The I2C adress of the LCD has been found using the I2C adress scanner, which is easily found on Arduino website. If using a different LCD in later versions,
  re-run the I2C scanner to determine the new adress.

  COMMUNICATION
  The boat arduino uses the AltSoftSerial library, and the Submarine Arduino uses SoftwareSerial, because they offer different advantages. This has been found to be
  the best combination for this project, as AltSoftSerial makes the boat arduino much more efficient at transmitting Serial Data, and Submarine arduino must use

  ~brief description of Serial libraries used in this project~

  AltSoftSerial - Can simultaneously transmit and receive. Minimal interference with simultaneous use of HardwareSerial and other libraries.
  Consumes a 16 bit timer (and will not work with any libraries which need that timer) and disables some PWM pins. Can be sensitive to interrupt usage by other libraries.
  **THIS IS TIMER1 (16 bits): you could use any one of the analog pins as an input for the 16 bit timer.. to replace pins 8 and 9, used as RX and TX respectively

  AltSoftSerial always uses these pins (it can have only one instance, but is much more efficient):
               Transmit  Receive   PWM Unusable
  Arduino Uno        9         8         10

  SoftwareSerial(formerly "NewSoftSerial") - Can have multiple instances on almost any pins, but only 1 can be active at a time. Can not simultaneously transmit and receive.
  Can interfere with other libraries or HardwareSerial if used at slower baud rates. Can be sensitive to interrupt usage by other libraries.
  This is the library used for the other arduino in this project, the one located in the submarine, because it uses servo library, which is incompatible with AltSoftSerial,
  and Submarine arduino also needs 2 instances of software serial (which is also a AltSoftSerial limitation):
  one for the serial communication with the boat, and another for the vertical SONAR altimeter.
  The hardware serial port is kept for debugging purposes, but it could be used for a second SONAR altimeter, targetting forward to detect incoming obstacles.
